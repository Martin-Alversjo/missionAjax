## Purpose
The purpose for Mission Ajax is to create a application where the user can get information from a api about the things the user puts in the input forms. This assignment will help me get a better understanding on how to work with Ajax and Api:s. 

### The API:s I will use are:
[NASA APOD api](https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod)
[Restcountries](www.restcountries.eu)
[Openweather.org](openweather.org)

In the application I will try my best to give the user freedom in what information it wants from the api:s. For example from the [Restcountries](www.restcountries.eu) api, the user should be able to get information about how much population a country or in what continent the country lies.

## Functionality
The user will use input form's. The input forms will have different options on what information the user wants as feedback from the api.
In the RestCountries api the user will get to choose via checkboxes what information it wants to receive from the api.
I will try to style it as best as I can to make it look good aswell and ofcourse be responsive.

### Technologies
The technologies I have been using are the following: 
 1. HTML
 2. CSS
 3. Bootstrap
 4. Javascript with jQuery

## Things to improve
In the NASA api page I need to make the images more responsive. And also I would like to add the EPIC api on the NASA page. from that api you can 'GET' images taken from space on earth.
I would like to add more functionality too the WeatherApp, for example a dropdown menu with choices what too get.
The flag images in the Countries section needs some size improvements aswell.
