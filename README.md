# Mission Ajax

## Purpose
The purpose for Mission Ajax is to create a application where the user can get information from a api about the things the user puts in the input forms. This assignment will help me get a better understanding on how to work with Ajax and Api:s. 
### The API:s I will use are:
[WordsApi](www.wordsapi.com)
[Restcountries](www.restcountries.eu)

In the application I will try my best to give the user freedom in what information it wants from the api:s. For example from the [Restcountries](www.restcountries.eu) api the user should be able to get information about how much population a country or in what continent the country lies.

## Functionality
The user will use input form's. The input forms will have different options on what information the user wants as feedback from the api.
